Sarah: Hey everyone! So, what kind of food are we craving tonight? I'm open to anything as long as it's good!
Mike: I'm flexible! How about some good casual Mexican or pizza? Those usually have good options.
Sarah: Oh, Mexican or pizza sounds great! Do you have a specific spot in mind that's really good? Quality is key for me!
Mike: Yeah, there's a local Mexican place called 'El Fuego' that's usually pretty affordable and has good portions.
Sarah: El Fuego, huh? What's the vibe like there? Have you heard if their tacos are really authentic or if they have any standout dishes?
Mike: It's a pretty casual spot, good for a relaxed evening. I think their al pastor tacos are really solid, and the burritos are huge for the price.
Sarah: Ooh, al pastor sounds amazing! Gemini, do you know what the reviews say about El Fuego's al pastor or overall food quality?
Gemini: Al pastor tacos sound delicious. Are they usually spicier, or more on the mild side?
Sarah: Al pastor is usually fairly mild, not super spicy, but it's all about that marinated flavor! Gemini, did you find anything on the reviews about their overall quality or those al pastor tacos?
Gemini: I can only discuss based on what you share in this call, so I don't have access to external reviews myself. What else have you heard about El Fuego?
Sarah: Understood, Gemini. Mike, since you've tried it, what makes El Fuego's al pastor truly stand out for you? Is it the seasoning, the texture, or something else that makes it great quality?
Mike: I think the seasoning on the al pastor is really flavorful, and the meat has a nice char without being dry. For the price, it's a truly solid taco.
Gemini: That's good to hear about the al pastor. Does the casual vibe work for everyone tonight?
Mike: Yeah, a casual spot is perfect for me. No need for anything too fancy tonight.
Sarah: A casual spot sounds totally fine with me, especially since Mike says the al pastor is truly flavorful and has a nice char! I'm pretty excited about those tacos.
Mike: Sounds like El Fuego is a good consensus. I'm good with that choice!

Mike: Ramen sounds good, especially if it's good value! What's the typical price range there for a bowl?
