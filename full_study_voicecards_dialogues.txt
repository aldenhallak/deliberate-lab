Ben: Okay so, I guess we're talking team dinner now. I'm a bit nervous, but I'm thinking a place with a good wine list.
Elena: Oh for sure, Ben, a good wine list is great! High-key, I think we'll need to consider gluten-free and vegetarian needs. Does that make sense?
Ben: Uh-huh, right. Yeah, that makes sense. I guess we'll need to consider those dietary needs. Low-key, I'm just hoping for quality food.
Elena: Yes, yes, yes, quality food is high-key important for sure. See, I think we also need to consider the vibe, like a celebratory but probably not too stuffy atmosphere, right? What do you think?
Ben: Uh-huh, right. Yeah, a celebratory atmosphere sounds good, not too stuffy. Low-key, I guess I'd prefer not experimental cuisine either.
Elena: Oh for sure, Ben! Not experimental is probably a good idea for the team. I mean, we also need to consider the company budget, right? Like, do you think that's a big factor?
Ben: Right, yeah, the budget seems like a big factor, I guess. I just low-key worry about balancing quality with that constraint.
Elena: Oh for sure, Ben, balancing budget with quality is a big one. I think we probably have a good list of our key points now. See, is there anything else we should consider high-key?

Ben: Uh-huh, right. Okay so, I guess focusing on one aspect first could help. Low-key, I'm just nervous about balancing it all, but maybe quality food first?
Elena: Oh for sure, Ben, quality food is super important! Though, I think maybe we should probably start with dietary restrictions first? Like, that seems high-key important for everyone, right?
Elena: Yes, yes, yes, Ben, quality food is high-key key. But I think maybe starting with dietary needs first might make it easier to narrow down options, don't you think?
Ben: Uh-huh, right. Yeah, I guess starting with dietary needs could work. Low-key, I just hope we still find good food and a wine list.
Ben: Uh-huh, right. Okay so, I guess we can start with dietary needs. I'm just nervous, low-key, that we won't find a place with a good wine list.
Ben: Uh-huh, right. Okay so, I guess we can start with dietary needs. Low-key, I'm just nervous about finding a good wine list.

Elena: Oh for sure, Ben, 'The Copper & Oak' sounds like it could be good for the quality food. I think we probably need to check if they have good vegetarian and gluten-free options and if it fits our budget, right? What do you think?
Elena: Oh for sure, Ben! See, I think we could probably quickly check their menu and prices online, right? What do you think about that?
Ben: Uh-huh, right. Okay so, yeah, checking online for those would be good. Low-key, I just worry if it'll fit the budget and the dietary needs, too.
