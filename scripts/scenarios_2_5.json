    "scenario": "Sarah's father, Mark, frequently helps care for his grandchildren, Leo (7) and Mia (4), a couple of days a week. While Sarah is grateful for his support, she and Mark often find themselves at odds over parenting styles, which creates confusion for the children. Mark, from a more traditional upbringing, struggles particularly with Mia's extreme picky eating (believing she should just eat what's served) and managing Leo's occasional tantrums (preferring 'tough love' over modern emotional regulation techniques). Sarah wants to respect her father but also needs consistency in their parenting approaches. They've arranged this meeting with Dr. Alex Kim to openly discuss their differences, find common ground, and develop unified strategies for addressing picky eating and tantrum management.",

She's open to new ideas but also skeptical about methods that sound too good to be true or require a huge time investment she doesn't have. She also struggles with finding time for herself.",
