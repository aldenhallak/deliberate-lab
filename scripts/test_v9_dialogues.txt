[09:46:19] Sarah: Hey guys, tough week. I really just want something simple, affordable, with good reviews tonight.
[09:46:23] Mark: Hey Sarah, I'm totally craving pizza tonight! It's usually simple and affordable, plus we can definitely find a spot with awesome reviews.
[09:46:36] Sarah: Yeah, pizza could work, I guess. Any other ideas on cuisine though? I'm so tired.
[09:46:40] Mark: Totally get wanting other options! Pizza is easy, but a relaxed burger spot or tacos could be fun too.
[09:46:45] Sarah: Oh, tacos or burgers both sound pretty easy. Are tacos typically cheaper, you think?
[09:46:51] Mark: Yeah, tacos are often cheaper than burgers. We could find a fun, laid-back taco place!
[09:47:00] Sarah: Okay, good to know that works. Are there any particular taco places with great reviews?
[09:47:02] Mark: Oh, 'Taco Heaven' is a casual spot with awesome reviews that comes to mind!
[09:47:08] Sarah: Oh, Taco Heaven! I've heard of that. Is it pretty quick and affordable?
[09:47:13] Mark: Totally! Taco Heaven is fast, really affordable, and has a super relaxed vibe. Perfect for a chill night!
[09:47:17] Sarah: Okay, that works! Taco Heaven sounds pretty ideal for tonight, actually. It's easy.
