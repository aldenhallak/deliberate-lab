Liam: Hey Gemini, I need some help planning a surprise anniversary dinner for my partner. I'm looking for a romantic, quiet spot downtown with vegetarian and gluten-free options, ideally within a $100-$150 per person budget.
Gemini: Of course. Let me look into some options that fit those criteria for you.
Gemini: I've found a place called The Gilded Lily. It's a French-American restaurant downtown known for its romantic atmosphere and has a dedicated vegetarian and gluten-free menu. How does that sound?
Liam: That sounds promising! What's the general price range, and do they have any special features like a nice view or unique desserts to make the evening memorable?
Gemini: The price is within your budget, around $120 per person. They're known for their chocolate lava cake and have a lovely view of the city skyline.
Liam: Okay, that sounds like a great option, exactly what I was looking for! The Gilded Lily it is.
